# Hotel Computer Network Design

This project involves the design and configuration of a computer network for a hotel located in a single city. The network is intended to support 30-45 end-user devices and 15-25 networking devices, including personal computers, laptops, servers, printers, VoIP devices, IoT devices, routers, switches, and security devices. 

## Key Features:
- Static IP addressing and subnetting.
- VLAN implementation to separate different network functions:
  - **VLAN 10 (PINK)**: Administration
  - **VLAN 20 (YELLOW)**: IT Services
  - **VLAN 30 (BLUE)**: Clients
- Router for interconnecting switches across the hotel floors.
- Specific cabling and network equipment considerations.

## Files Included:
- **Network Design (.pkt)**: Cisco Packet Tracer file to execute the network design.
- **Documentation (PDF & DOCS)**: Project documentation with detailed explanations of the design, configuration steps, and network functionality.

## How to Use:
1. Open the `.pkt` file in Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Execute and simulate the network operations.
3. Review the included documentation for detailed insights into the design and configuration.
